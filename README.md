## Project Overview
This project analyses sales data from a sample dataset to create a **Sales KPI Dashboard**. The goal is to provide actionable insights into sales trends, regional performance, product performance, and shipping efficiency.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing using Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on sales data
- Visualisations using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Key insights documented in `INSIGHTS.md`
- Data summarization and aggregation using Python `groupby` and `sum()` (equivalent to Excel Pivot Tables)

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming:** Python (Pandas, NumPy), SQL
- **Data Visualisation:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook, VS Code
- **Data:** CSV files stored in the `data/` folder

## Notes
- Visualisations include bar charts, line plots, and distribution plots for key KPIs such as total sales, sales by year, sales by region, top products, and shipping efficiency.
